## Problem Statement
In today's competitive banking environment, customer retention is crucial for sustained business growth. Losing customers, commonly referred to as customer churn, directly impacts a bank's profitability and growth potential. Identifying customers who are likely to churn can help banks implement strategies to retain them, thereby reducing the impact of customer loss.

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will leave the bank (churn) based on various features, including customer demographics, account details, and engagement with the bank. By accurately predicting customer churn, the bank can take proactive measures to retain high-risk customers, improving overall customer satisfaction and reducing churn rates.

The dataset consists of 10,000 bank customers from different countries, along with features such as credit score, age, tenure, account balance, and whether they have exited the bank. The goal is to leverage this data to create an effective predictive model that can assist the bank in identifying customers at risk of leaving, enabling timely interventions.

*Objectives:
- Understand the factors that influence customer churn.
- Build a predictive model to classify customers as churned or non-churned.
- Provide insights into customer behavior to help the bank improve its retention strategies.
